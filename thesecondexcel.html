        The second version of Excel, known as Excel 2.0, was a significant milestone in the history of spreadsheet software. Released in 1987 by Microsoft, it built upon the foundation of the original Excel, introducing several notable features that would shape the future of spreadsheet computing. Excel 2.0 offered improved performance and stability, making it a more reliable tool for businesses and individuals alike. It also introduced the concept of multiple worksheets within a single workbook, a feature that remains a fundamental aspect of Excel to this day. Additionally, Excel 2.0 expanded its formula library, providing users with a broader range of mathematical and statistical functions. This version marked a crucial step in Excel's evolution, setting the stage for its continued dominance in the spreadsheet software market and its integral role in modern data analysis and financial modeling.    </p></center>
