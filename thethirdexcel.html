        The third version of Excel, Excel 3.0, which was released in 1990, represented a significant leap forward in spreadsheet software technology. Building on the success of its predecessors, Excel 3.0 introduced several groundbreaking features that revolutionized data manipulation and analysis. Perhaps the most notable innovation was the introduction of VBA (Visual Basic for Applications), a powerful scripting language that allowed users to automate tasks, create custom functions, and enhance the program's functionality. This opened up a world of possibilities for businesses and individuals looking to tailor Excel to their specific needs. Excel 3.0 also improved upon its charting capabilities, making it easier to create visually compelling graphs and charts for data presentation. With these advancements, Excel solidified its position as the leading spreadsheet software and laid the groundwork for the future integration of VBA into Microsoft Office, a decision that would shape the software landscape for years to come.
