        Excel 4.0, released by Microsoft in 1992, marked yet another significant evolution in spreadsheet software. This version of Excel continued to build on the program's growing reputation for innovation and usability. One of the standout features of Excel 4.0 was the introduction of macro recording, which simplified the automation of repetitive tasks by allowing users to record a series of actions and play them back as needed. This feature greatly enhanced productivity and made Excel even more versatile for both novice and advanced users. Additionally, Excel 4.0 expanded its function library, adding new mathematical and statistical functions that catered to the diverse needs of spreadsheet users. With these enhancements, Excel solidified its position as the go-to spreadsheet software for professionals, businesses, and academics, paving the way for its continued dominance in the world of data analysis, financial modeling, and beyond.
